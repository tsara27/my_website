Hi! My name is Tsara Fatma Larasati Sudrajat, I know it is a long name. Just call me Tsara.

I am a wife, mentor, teacher, and Ruby on Rails developer, and loving all of them so much. Studying in English Education department, but it will never stop me to learn how to be a professional Ruby on Rails developer. I am a traitor of my own major, English Education department. Ruby on Rails is my passion. I was falling in love with Ruby at the first sight even feeling weird to see a line of code without semicolon.

I was at college when I was realized that I had passion in coding. I applied a job without letting my parents know. Surprisingly, I was accepted and worked as Codeigniter developer. I had been working as Codeigniter developer for two years. Then, in 2013 I met my husband. He introduced me to Ruby on Rails and asked me to learn it even he is UI/UX designer. I started to know Ruby at the moment and stopped to learn it because it was really busy at English department.

In the beginning of 2014, I dared myself to take annual leave for my college and learned Ruby and Rails from scratch. I made some repositories on <a href="https://github.com/tsara27/">GitHub</a>
 in learning Rails. I got help from my mentor in learning Rails. On the 4th months of learning, I got my first job. I was working as sub contractor, developing credit workbench web application for one of US banks using Ruby on Rails.

Now I just started to write tutorials, article about life, and codes. Please enjoy!
