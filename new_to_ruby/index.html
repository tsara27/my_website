    <p>First time I saw ruby and ruby on rails was terrible. I really hate command line. But, my willing to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails had destroyed the brick and made me crazy about Ruby and Rails. Such a willingness won't help at all, especially if you are easily bored when reading some tutorials filled only by text. Some interesting exercises would be very helpful for you to make you fall in love with Ruby and Rails, make you feel more curious about them, then feel just fine when reading tutorials which raise your boredom at the first time. These are some interesting exercises that are going to make you fall in love with them.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Try Ruby</li>
      <li>Codeacademy – Ruby path</li>
      <li>Codeschool – Ruby path</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Already fell in love with them? If yes, you may continue to read tutorials below. If it's not, I think you should find other path to start your coding adventure. Ruby just not click with you. So, here they are.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Try Ruby</li>
      <li>Codeacademy – Ruby path</li>
      <li>Codeschool – Ruby path</li>
    </ul>
    After you learn the tutorials above, you have prepared the theory of coding adventure. I think you'd better to get started to real world. You may create few simple applications using Ruby or Rails, eg. Simple To-do, blog, guestbook, simple social media, etc. Prepare your sword and buckler! Go fight to defeat real challenges!
