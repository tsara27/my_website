title: Are you new to Ruby or Rails?
description: First time I saw ruby and ruby on rails was terrible. I really hate command line. But, my willing to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails had destroyed the brick and made me crazy about Ruby and Rails. Such a willingness won't help at all, especially if you are easily bored when reading some tutorials filled only by text. Some interesting exercises would be very helpful for you to make you fall in love with Ruby and Rails, make you feel more curious about them, then feel just fine when reading tutorials which raise your boredom at the first time. These are some interesting exercises that are going to make you fall in love with them.
