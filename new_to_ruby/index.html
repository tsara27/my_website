    <p>First time I saw ruby and ruby on rails was terrible. I really hate command line. But, my willing to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails had destroyed the brick and made me crazy about Ruby and Rails. Such a willingness won’t help at all, especially if you are easily bored when reading some tutorials filled only by text. Some interesting exercises would be very helpful for you to make you fall in love with Ruby and Rails, make you feel more curious about them, then feel just fine when reading tutorials which raise your boredom at the first time. These are some interesting exercises that are going to make you fall in love with them.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ruby" target="_blank">Try Ruby</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby" target="_blank">Codeacademy - Ruby path</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/paths/ruby" target="_blank">Codeschool - Ruby path</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Already fell in love with them? If yes, you may continue to read tutorials below. If it’s not, I think you should find other path to start your coding adventure. Ruby just not click with you. So, here the tutorials.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/introduction" target="_blank">Launchschool - Introduction to Programming with Ruby</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/introduction" target="_blank">Launchschool - Object Oriented Programming with Ruby</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/" target="_blank">Jumpstartlab - Ruby on Rails Tutorials</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book" target="_blank">Michael Hartl - Learn Web Development with Rails by Michael Hartl</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After you learn the tutorials above, you have prepared the theory of coding adventure. I think you’d better to get started to real world. You can website applications using Ruby or Rails, eg. Simple To-do, blog, guestbook, simple social media, etc. You will gain tons of experience from real project. Good luck!</p>
